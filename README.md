# CheckersUIAutomation

Working on automating a program to play checkers at https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/checkers/ using Java.

Skip to around 1:05 to see output and game play begin and end. Feel free to contribute! 
The code is long and messy and inefficient at this point.

### Future Development
1. Logic to evaluate best moves;
2. Logic to jump/capture blue pieces;
3. Logic for kings;
4. Efficient code to re-capture target spaces after each move by player and computer
